# python_class_projects (lottery)

In this task, we are interested by the probabilities of the player winning the jackpot, ie. guessing all the balls correctly. In Finnish lottery, for instance, this would mean the probability of the player guessing all 7 balls correctly with only one lottery ticket.

This is a combinatorics-related problem: how many different ways are there to select 7 balls from 39 balls? Let's assume that 

n is the number of balls in a lottery and 

p the number of the predicted balls. In this case, there are

different lottery lines. The ! operator above is used in mathematics to describe a factorial of the number preceding it, i.e. the product of all the positive integers smaller than this number, the number included.
